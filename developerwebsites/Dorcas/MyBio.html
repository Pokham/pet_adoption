			My name is Dorcas Mbaeri, and I am a senior at the University of Houston- Downtown.
			I am a Math and Computer Science major (with also a minor in Applied Statistics) and will
			be graduating in Spring 2018. I am currently seeking IT internships at local companies in 
			Houston, such as ExxonMobil, Shell, Tandem Hospital Partners, Golden Section
			Technology, and more. My goal is to be a data scientist. I will pursue my Masters in Data 
			Science at the University of Wisconsin upon graduation; it is an online degree program. 
			I also would like to obtain an MBA degree at Wharton's School of Business (University of Pennsylvania).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I have completed two internships in the past two summers. My first internship was in summer 2016.
			I was an IT Intern at a company called Health Care Navigator, which is in White Plains, New York.
			I worked specifically in the Business Intelligence department. I also completed another 
			internship this past summer for a company named Alliance Data Card Services in Columbus, Ohio.
			My position was an Application Programmer-Analyst Intern. I really loved both internships!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			As a graduating senior, I have started to apply for some full-time jobs at several companies. Below are some
			places I have applied to and their positions:
